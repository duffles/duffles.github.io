Where It Was Lost is a piece of sculptural poetry designed by artist Taylor Apostol with poetry by me. Conceived as a piece which would fit neatly into a traditional box but be built into an organic form, the poemâ€™s words are burnt into the wooden forms, building the poem like a puzzle as you assemble it one piece at a time.
