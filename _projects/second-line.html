The Second Line Social Aid and Pleasure Society Brass Band is a New Orleans-style street band, based in Somerville and Cambridge, Massachusetts. We combine music with social action, slamming out the sounds of the legendary Crescent City for peace rallies, street festivals, parades, and benefits. We are also a part of the organizing force behind <a href=”http://honkfest.org”>HONK!</a>, a festival of activist street bands that takes place every October in Somerville’s Davis Square.
