		What you are about to see...once the large file loads below...is a collection of images drawn by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/404103784/">this spirograph project</a> in Scratch. Each of these images was <code>outer radius</code> was held constant at 150 for all drawings. Each row represents a different <code>pen radius</code>, and each column represents a different <code>inner radius</code>. Both of them start at 10 and increase by 10 with each row/column.
